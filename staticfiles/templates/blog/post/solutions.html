                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Addressing climate change requires a multifaceted approach involving efforts from individuals, communities, governments, and businesses. Solutions range from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to adapting to changes and building resilience.</p>

                <h2>Mitigation Strategies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Renewable Energy:</strong> Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power reduces dependence on fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Improving energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industries helps reduce energy consumption and emissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Carbon Sequestration:</strong> Planting trees, restoring forests, and using carbon capture technology can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it safely.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="/static/solutions.png" alt="Renewable Energy" />

                <h2>Adaptation Measures</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Building Resilience:</strong> Developing infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events helps communities adapt to climate change impacts.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Implementing efficient water management practices and technologies ensures a sustainable supply of water in changing climate conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disaster Preparedness:</strong> Preparing for and responding to natural disasters through early warning systems and emergency plans can reduce the impact of extreme events.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="/static/solutions.png" alt="Adaptation Measures" />

                <h2>Policy and International Cooperation</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Climate Policies:</strong> Governments can implement policies and regulations to limit emissions, promote sustainability, and incentivize green technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>International Agreements:</strong> Global cooperation through agreements like the Paris Agreement aims to unite countries in the fight against climate change and set targets for reducing emissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Educating the public about climate change and encouraging sustainable practices helps drive collective action and support for climate solutions.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="/static/solutions.png" alt="Climate Policy" />

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Effective solutions to climate change require a combination of mitigation, adaptation, and policy efforts. By taking action at all levels, we can work towards a sustainable future and address the challenges posed by climate change.</p>
